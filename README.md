# Bank_Management_C

Hello folks!
I have developed a C application to manage basic banking operations like
 - Creating accounts
 - Withdrawal of funds
 - Deposition of funds
 - Checking Balance
 - Updating the details of existing accounts

The main motive behind developing this application in **C language** was to improve 
- Programming Efficiency
- Easy Debugging
